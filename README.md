This code is a simple calculator implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Functions:

button_click(value): This function is called when a number or operator button is clicked. It updates the display with the clicked value.
clear_display(): This function is called when the "C" button is clicked. It clears the display.
calculate(): This function is called when the "=" button is clicked. It evaluates the expression in the display and displays the result. If an error occurs during evaluation, it displays "Error."
Main Window Setup:

The main window is created using tk.Tk() and titled "Simple Calculator."
Entry Widget:

An Entry widget is used to display the input and output. It's positioned at the top (row=0, column=0) and spans four columns.
Buttons:

The calculator buttons are defined in a 4x4 grid, where each button corresponds to a digit or operator.
A loop is used to create buttons, and based on the symbol:
For digits and operators (except "C" and "="), a lambda function is used to pass the corresponding value to the button_click function.
For "C," the clear_display function is assigned to the button's command.
For "=", the calculate function is assigned to the button's command.
Application Run:

Finally, the application is run with root.mainloop().
To use this calculator, you can click the buttons to input numbers and perform calculations. The "C" button clears the display, and the "=" button calculates and displays the result.

Note: The use of eval() in the calculate function can pose security risks if the input is not properly sanitized. For a more secure implementation, consider using a safer approach to evaluate mathematical expression.






This code defines a simple password generator GUI using Tkinter in Python. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Function:

generate_password(): This function is called when the "Generate Password" button is clicked. It takes the user-defined password length and strength, generates a password accordingly, and displays it in the entry widget.
Main Window Setup:

The main window is created using tk.Tk() and titled "Password Generator."
Labels:

Two labels are created to prompt the user for input: one for the password length and one for selecting the password strength.
Entry Widgets:

An entry widget (length_entry) is used for the user to input the desired password length.
Another entry widget (password_entry) is used to display the generated password. The show="" argument is used to hide the actual characters in the entry widget.
Radio Buttons:

Three radio buttons (weak_radio, medium_radio, and strong_radio) are created to allow the user to select the password strength. The options are "Weak," "Medium," and "Strong." The selected strength is stored in the strength_var variable.
Button:

A button (generate_button) is created to trigger the password generation process. The generate_password function is assigned to its command.
Application Run:

Finally, the application is run with root.mainloop().
When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, the generate_password function is called. It checks the selected strength and generates a password using lowercase letters, a combination of uppercase letters and digits, or a combination of uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation, based on the chosen strength. The generated password is then displayed in the password_entry widget.

This provides a simple way for users to generate passwords with varying strengths based on their preferences.



This code defines a simple contact book GUI using Tkinter in Python. The application allows users to add, delete, and edit contacts. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Functions:

add_contact(): This function is called when the "Add Contact" button is clicked. It retrieves the name and number from the entry widgets, adds a new contact to the listbox, and clears the entry widgets.
delete_contact(): This function is called when the "Delete Contact" button is clicked. It deletes the selected contact from the listbox.
edit_contact(): This function is called when the "Edit Contact" button is clicked. It opens a new window (edit_window) where the user can modify the name and number of the selected contact. After clicking "Save," the modified contact is updated in the listbox.
Main Window Setup:

The main window is created using tk.Tk() and titled "Contact Book."
Entry widgets (name_entry and number_entry) are provided for entering contact details.
Labels, buttons, and a listbox are also added to the main window.
Add Contact Entry Widgets:

Two entry widgets (name_entry and number_entry) are used to input the name and number of a new contact.
Buttons:

Three buttons are created:
"Add Contact" (add_button) triggers the add_contact function.
"Delete Contact" (delete_button) triggers the delete_contact function.
"Edit Contact" (edit_button) triggers the edit_contact function.
Listbox:

A listbox (contact_list) is used to display the list of contacts.
Edit Contact Window:

When the "Edit Contact" button is clicked, a new window (edit_window) is created.
Two entry widgets (edit_name_entry and edit_number_entry) are provided for modifying the name and number.
The "Save" button triggers the save_edit function, which updates the contact in the listbox and closes the edit_window.
Application Run:

Finally, the application is run with root.mainloop().
This simple contact book allows users to interactively manage their contacts through an easy-to-use graphical interface.
