This code is a simple calculator implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Functions:

button_click(value): This function is called when a number or operator button is clicked. It updates the display with the clicked value.
clear_display(): This function is called when the "C" button is clicked. It clears the display.
calculate(): This function is called when the "=" button is clicked. It evaluates the expression in the display and displays the result. If an error occurs during evaluation, it displays "Error."
Main Window Setup:

The main window is created using tk.Tk() and titled "Simple Calculator."
Entry Widget:

An Entry widget is used to display the input and output. It's positioned at the top (row=0, column=0) and spans four columns.
Buttons:

The calculator buttons are defined in a 4x4 grid, where each button corresponds to a digit or operator.
A loop is used to create buttons, and based on the symbol:
For digits and operators (except "C" and "="), a lambda function is used to pass the corresponding value to the button_click function.
For "C," the clear_display function is assigned to the button's command.
For "=", the calculate function is assigned to the button's command.
Application Run:

Finally, the application is run with root.mainloop().
To use this calculator, you can click the buttons to input numbers and perform calculations. The "C" button clears the display, and the "=" button calculates and displays the result.

Note: The use of eval() in the calculate function can pose security risks if the input is not properly sanitized. For a more secure implementation, consider using a safer approach to evaluate mathematical expression.
